                 projection-based partial evaluation methods formalised
                 in the author's earlier `Re-examination' paper.
                 Turchin's `driving' transformation, known to yield more
                 efficient specialised programs, is in this paper for
                 the first time put on a solid semantic foundation which
                 is not tied to any particular programming language or
                 data structure. The new approach includes both
                 projection-based methods and driving in a natural and
                 simple way, and eases formulating correctness of
                 residual code generation.},
